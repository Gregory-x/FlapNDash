# Flappy-Bird
Flappy Bird is a 2D game where players control a small bird, guiding it through a series of obstacles (pipes) with just a tap to make the bird go upwards. The goal is to navigate the bird through these gaps without hitting the pipes or the ground, scoring points for every successful pass. The longer you survive, the higher your score.
### How to demo
Start the application, click the Start button and your character, a bird is going to show up. Then you must press space every time you wish to move the bird upwards. You are going to see some pipes; you have to go through the hole between these obstacles. If you touch any of the pipes you lost, then you can either click on the New Game button or the Exit one. Also there’s a score counter on the top of your screen.
## Features:
•	Tap to Fly Mechanics: Players tap to keep the bird in the air, navigating it through obstacles.

•	Infinite Game Loop: The game continues indefinitely until the player crashes

•	Physics-based Gameplay: Gravity constantly pulls the bird down, creating a balancing challenge.

•	Randomly Generated Pipes: Pipes appear at random heights, increasing the challenge.

•	Simple Graphics and Sounds: Minimalistic art and sound effects enhance the game

•	Scoring System: Players earn points for every pair of pipes they pass through.

•	Game Over Screen and Restart Option: Easy restart for immediate replays after failure.

## Which learning goals do we cover?
•	Physics Simulation: Understand and implement simple physics concepts like gravity and jumping mechanics.

•	Collision Detection: Learn how to detect interactions between objects (bird and pipes).

•	Procedural Content Generation: Randomly generate obstacles to make each playthrough unique.
